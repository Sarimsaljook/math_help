##### MathHelp
MathHelp is a peer-to-peer learning platform designed for IGCSE math students to upload and analyze solved math problems. Students can share their scanned solutions and learn from each otherâ€™s approaches and mistakes. Instead of relying solely on teacher-provided solutions, MathHelp allows students to gain new perspectives on problem-solving.

### Features
Upload and Share Solutions: Students can upload their scanned math solutions to the platform for others to view.
Learn from Peers: By viewing how other students solve problems, users can gain a deeper understanding of various solving methods.
Error Recognition: Students can learn from common mistakes made by others and avoid repeating them.
Authentication: Firebase authentication to ensure secure login and registration.
Cloud Storage: Firebase Cloud Storage to securely store and access uploaded solutions.
Tech Stack
Frontend: React JS
Backend: Firebase Authentication & Firebase Cloud Storage
